## Version Control
The project will use GitHub for version control. All team members will collaborate through GitHub to ensure proper version management and synchronization of code changes. Key practices include:
- Branching: Each developer will work on separate branches for different features or tasks.
- Commit and Push: Developers will commit and push their changes regularly to keep the repository updated.
- Pull Requests and Code Reviews: Changes will be merged into the main branch after code reviews through pull requests.
- Conflict Resolution: Any merge conflicts will be manually resolved before merging.
- Tagging: Significant milestones, such as prototypes or final releases, will be tagged in the repository for version tracking.

This structure ensures the project is well-organized and allows for efficient collaboration and version control.
