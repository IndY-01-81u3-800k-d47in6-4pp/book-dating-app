## Abstract:
Bridging the gap between technology and literature, our app offers a fresh and interactive approach to book discovery, turning the search for a good read into a delightful and personalized journey.
 
Our Book Dating Software redefines the convenience and carefree experience of modern dating apps as a revolutionary tool for book lovers interested in finding their next great read. Users are presented with a queue of potential candidates for new stories that can be “accepted” or “rejected” at their discretion. Each item in this queue contains information on the book such as its genre and a brief description of its contents. Titles that seem interesting to the user are added to a “To Be Read” list, and users can set filters to choose which types of books to receive in their queue.
